> **ImpproveLLMStructure** â€” An intelligent correct system for LLM's

---



# ImproveLLMStructure
Identifies the incoming prompt and the LLM response than aligns and converts, improves system stability and allows for working with less capable models. 
For instance if you send a prompt request in python or json or plaintext it will try to reason the expected format and convert the LLM responses to whatever you want to recieve back.

# Improved LLM Structure

A powerful open-source framework for building agentic AI systems that enables seamless communication between specialized language models through format transformation.

## Overview

Improved LLM Structure is a crucial component in building agentic AI systems, particularly when working with multiple specialized language models. It solves a fundamental challenge in AI infrastructure: enabling different models to communicate effectively by transforming their outputs into various formats.

Overview:

### Key Features

- **Format Transformation**: Convert between different data formats (JSON, Markdown, Python, plain text)
- **Local Model Integration**: Works with quantized 8-bit models for efficient local processing
- **Error Correction**: Built-in validation and error correction system
- **Learning System**: Improves over time through interaction data
- **Flexible API**: RESTful interface for easy integration
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handle various input and output formats seamlessly

## Why Use Improved LLM Structure?

When building agentic AI systems with multiple specialized models, each model might excel at different tasks and output formats. This tool acts as a "universal translator" between these models, allowing them to communicate effectively without:

- Consuming large context windows with format-specific tokens
- Compromising model performance by forcing specific output formats
- Requiring larger, more resource-intensive models for format transformation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Conda environment (recommended)
- Hugging Face model (8-bit quantized model recommended)
- Basic understanding of API communication

# Complete Setup Tutorial

https://www.loom.com/share/51b53e0a7200458a97923b21a0cc2d69?sid=df63c202-f36f-4db4-a800-635027cf25a2

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/improved-llm-structure.git
cd improved-llm-structure
```

2. Set up the Conda environment (recommended to use the same environment as the A-agent project):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namenotfound-ai/a_agent
```
Follow the setup requirements here:

https://www.loom.com/share/f19ac59a21ad4fd4b422552e958b3385?sid=1e26e48d-2643-4003-9288-1e65eb02de0f

3. Install git-lfs (required for downloading the model):
```bash
# For macOS using Homebrew
brew install git-lfs

# Initialize git-lfs
git lfs install
```

4. Download the phi-4-8bit model:
```bash
# Create a local_models directory
mkdir local_models
cd local_models

# Clone the model repository
# Note: This will download approximately 15GB of model files and may take several minutes
git clone https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/phi-4-8bit --progress

# If you want to clone without large files - just their pointers
# GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/phi-4-8bit
```

5. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install mlx-lm
```

6. Copy the local_model.py file to the model directory:
```bash
# From the project root directory
cp local_model.py local_models/phi-4-8bit/
```

3. Download a Hugging Face model (8-bit quantized model recommended) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Start the local model server:
```bash
# Navigate to the model directory
cd local_models/phi-4-8bit

# Start the server
python local_model.py
```
This will start the server on port 5015 by default.

2. Start the main application:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the server on port 5025 by default.

3. Make requests to the API using curl or any HTTP client:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5015/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Your input text here",
    "requested_format": "json"
  }'
```
Example:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5015/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Convert this text to json: Name: John Smith, Age: 35, Occupation: Software Engineer, Skills: Python, JavaScript, SQL",
    "output_format": "json"
  }'
```


### Configuration

You can modify the following settings in `config.py`:
- Local model endpoint
- Port numbers
- Default output format
- Other configuration parameters

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- `app.py`: Main application server
