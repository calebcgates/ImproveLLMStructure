ImproveLLMStructure â€” An intelligent correct system for LLM's


# ImproveLLMStructure
Identifies the incoming prompt and the LLM response than aligns and converts, improves system stability and allows for working with less capable models. 
For instance if you send a prompt request in python or json or plaintext it will try to reason the expected format and convert the LLM responses to whatever you want to recieve back.
